state keeps track of all the movies.it is like a short term memory..when we refresh it disaapers or u can understand it as a place to store information...it is basically a way to write variable in react

this is how we set state-here we will set the movie state
const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);//react hook concept-a hook is like a little functional pieces of code
initially value of use state is set to null here

now we need to populate this above piece of code

when the row components load we want ,we want to make a request to the tmdb to fetch ,which is done using the useEffect of hooks.
useEffect is a piece of code which runs on a specific conditions/variables


useEffect(()=>{
// code goes here
},[]);  //[] bracket is left empty ,then the code run once and don't run agian..

suppose if that [movies] ie []-bracket is not empty,then its gonna run once and it will run every time the movies changes ie it is dependent on that variable movie

in const[movie,setMovie]-every time the movie will change it will change

every time the row component will load this piece of code will fire always
